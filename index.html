            <p> I am a lifelong artist that is falling in love with the creativity that computer coding.  I have been either a musician or songwriter, a freelance writer and a painter the majority of my life.
            <p> I love dogs, but who doesn't? My dog Rylie is a rescued pitbull and she's my little buddy.  My wife and I just had our first daughter, Lily, in May 2019, and she has been my little piece of sunshine.  
                I cannot wait to go on this new life journey with them. </p>
